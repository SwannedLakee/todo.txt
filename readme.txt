# My todo list. 


Files:

* todo.txt

The list of actions I'm going to do. Sorted [by integrity](http://joereddington.com/6384/2017/03/19/making-your-priority-list-actually-work./)

* add_reoccuring_events.sh

A script to add reoccurring events using the Igor submodule.

* done.txt

A (very inconsistently used) list of actions completed. Just because something isn't in here doesn't mean it didn't happen. Sometimes I directly delete done actions. 


* historic_notes.md
Notes on work sprints that don't belong anywhere else. 

* igor

Submodule for adding reoccurring events 

* readme.txt
