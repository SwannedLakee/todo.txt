##  Notes from current sprint 



## 14/05/19 12:12 
Thinking about comics. Let's talk about this. 

The goal is to take control of my day's narrative. Make it a positive one.  
Other goals include: taking more photographs, sharing more with friends. Experimenting and learning more about art.  

There's lots of different styles I'd like to try: 

* B&W (Sin city) 
* Old-school comic book
* Japanses 
* Very simple line drawings. 


What's our premise? That our central character is trying to pretend not to be sick? 


What's our premise? That our central character is a normal human being who can do superhuman THINGs when he confesses is small THINGs 
How about we throw away everything other than that? 

Today's THING is that I am sick and I don't have enough energy. 




## 16/05/19 10:08 
Okay, today is about Kat's owrk. 

I've got some code to run. 


What's the steps? 

* Find and open the folder 
* Take git snapshot
* Look at the old tests see which ones can be/should be changed. 


## 16/05/19 10:16 
I'm looking at the code and it's a mess. There should be nice classes and lots of other thTHINGings. 

What's the best way of structuring this code? 
What are the objects? 

Student
Exam

Each student is linked to one or more exams. Each exam is linked to one or more students. 

Oh, it was taking a really long time last time right? I couldn't work out why? have I got that right? 

## 16/05/19 10:20, Running tests 

We should disconnect the output on the word document from any other output. This includes making a fake class that accepts the same commands and is used as a test. 


## 16/05/19 10:21, 
Tests should execute quickly, we need to drop the one that takes ages. 

## 16/05/19 10:21 
Maybe start entirely again? 

## 16/05/19 10:31 
Okay, I've started an new THING, and the next THING to do is to get it to read all of the students from the student file 

- 16/05/19 smallest next step:  read file of students 

## 16/05/19 10:57 
I've learned something new and that's cool. I'm also technically looking for a bigger problem to write a test for.  

Obvious bigger problem would be to read in exams, but I want to check in with Kat before I do that, particularly because I'll want to read in the exam answers as well. 

Todo: 

* Student print_string method 
* build up the student more from the information given. 
* Import some more tests 
* Build the speedy testing class for the other file  


Okay, so the anonomisation isn't my problem for the moment, although I do have to do some thinking about how that would work.  I suspect that the solution is: fuck it, run it on Kat's machine. 

So what's next? 


## 16/05/19 11:31 
Put in a fake object for the writing of the word files 

## 16/05/19 11:42 
I think there is something more fundermentally borken than that.  Currently stuck on L1 

## 16/05/19 11:48 
Tracking it down with sentients. 


## 16/05/19 11:52 
Okay, the issue is that table add.row getting increasingly slow as the table gets bigger, but apparently i can do som  


## 16/05/19 11:55 
Yeah, I think I can do this differenty .


## 16/05/19 11:56 
We're starting again again. 

## 16/05/19 12:29 
Okay, making tiny progress, but only tiny. 

## 16/05/19 13:33 
Okay, why don't I just fix the problem? It's the import of the results. That's a seperate file. No, drink and nap.  
- 16/05/19 smallest next step:  copy the file into the folder. 

## 16/05/19 17:07 
So what's the next action? is it...  What is it? 


Let's talk about were we are. I've moved to an object oriented wayo f doing THINGs. I'm passing most of the tests but I'm also using the old way of recording exams so MAYBE we should start again and read all of those. Let's read all of those.  


## 16/05/19 17:11 
Crap, I can only read exams when I have already read the exam questions. So that means that I'm doing a very different THING when I read the exam questions first: and actually that ends up being quite useful because then I know the total marks availbile. 

Wait... that's NOT entirely true right? No, it's easier to know about the exam before we know about the exam results. 


What's the test for this? 


What's the total amount of marks for an exam 
What's the total amount of marks for an question 
How many questions are there for a level 


## 16/05/19 17:57 
So what's our understanding right now? That we can work out the exam from the umber. It's getting dicy isn't it? 


## 16/05/19 18:02
No, the next THING is to put the exam nubmer in the exam info sheet, then we'll have a fighting chance.
