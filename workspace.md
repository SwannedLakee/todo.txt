Thinking about comics. Let's talk about this. 

The goal is to take control of my day's narrative. Make it a positive one.  
Other goals include: taking more photographs, sharing more with friends. Experimenting and learning more about art.  

There's lots of different styles I'd like to try: 

* B&W (Sin city) 
* Old-school comic book
* Japanses 
* Very simple line drawings.
