## 11/09/19 09:28 to 11:43, Sorting out the old git projects in Dropbox +EQT
Good sick day activity. There were 12G of them (with some personal projects mixed in) 
The main query was 'what to do about desktop tracking' which I've moved to a different bit of dropbox' 

This eventually went down to less than a gig 

Obviously this doesn't end up being 'done' until I take it out of dropbox as well.
