(B) Map project for top vegan blogs 

Okay, let's have a bit of a look at this one. 


I'm using the 'blogranking' list rather than the 'topblogs' for now. 

I used this site as a basis: https://www.culinarynutrition.com/top-50-vegan-blogs/ 

And I've reduced it down.  And only 12 of them make the top 100, looks like we are doing this the hard way.  


It's running, we'll have a look and then MAYBE add some more information. 

Looks like we'll have to make it a UK vegan blog one: https://blog.feedspot.com/vegan_blogs/
