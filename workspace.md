Thinking about comics. Let's talk about this. 

The goal is to take control of my day's narrative. Make it a positive one.  
Other goals include: taking more photographs, sharing more with friends. Experimenting and learning more about art.  

There's lots of different styles I'd like to try: 

* B&W (Sin city) 
* Old-school comic book
* Japanses 
* Very simple line drawings. 


What's our premise? That our central character is trying to pretend not to be sick? 


What's our premise? That our central character is a normal human being who can do superhuman THINGs when he confesses is small THINGs 
How about we throw away everything other than that? 

Today's THING is that I am sick and I don't have enough energy.

What's the best way of structuring this code? 
What are the objects?
