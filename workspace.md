This is excellent. My understanding of what we have to do...  

## 22/07/19 07:31 
Okay, literally none of the numbers match up with numbers in Quickbooks 

## 22/07/19 07:34 
Okay, so it's definately NOT clear to me why total debtors on my own balance sheet is negative. 

## 22/07/19 07:39 
Okay, the invoices are messed up, that's the problem, I've got invoices that are over multiple finantial years. 

## 22/07/19 07:49 
I've fixed the invoice a bit, now the amount is too much but hey... 

## 22/07/19 08:01 
p6 'Taxation and Social Security' is the amount we have to pay out in tax this year. 
Other creditors are presumably the total amount of grants that we are spending down. 


## 22/07/19 07:59 
Okay, list of questions to ask: 

* Can we have these in a different format. 
* Have you got a handy list of your trade debtors and other creditros 
* p8, you've cataogriesed that STUFF differently. 


## 22/07/19 10:16, 

I've been tiding up and am currently on hold.  Wondering what other bits need doing around the house. Oh, I can put a wash on, but don't blieve that counts.  Oh, Make seiten would be good.  
 




# Stack
* Create the invoice for this finantial year
