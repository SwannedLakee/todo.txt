I have been lax.

There should be a plan.

. Catch the exception and make it clear that it's a data error.  
. Work through the rest of the data until all errors are handled. [200~NO[201~
. Create a main function for the process.py: it should clearly output the errors. 
. Create the project file 
  . Create tests for filer for gender
  * Fix 'percentage_of_passing' because it's the pecentage of the students who pass, NOT the percentage of students that took the exam 
  . Create a filter for boys, girls, and all of the special circumstances, along with tests 
* Rearrange the testing so that there are several different setup/takedown classes 
* Redo the git history
