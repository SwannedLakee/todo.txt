##  Notes from current sprint 



## 27/05/19 10:38 to 11:00, Penfold
I've been working on getting penfold working, because I think that will help with comics. 



## 27/05/19 11:01, 
Some bugs: refresh isn't working well...  



## 27/05/19 11:10 
Working on the import scripts some more.  

[This person](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/14114/paste-link-to-image-in-clipboard-when-editing-markdown) knows exactly what I want.





## 27/05/19 11:26 
I've installed their plugin, but it needs xclip apparently. 


## 27/05/19 11:42 
I believe I have it working, but only for images in the clipboard, rather than files in the clipboard. Needs a bit of extension there.
