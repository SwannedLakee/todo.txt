Going to look at brainstorms

What do to about exercise...  I think the ideal would be to go running tonight, or MAYBE have a short time on the bike. 

I *could* go swimming, that would be fun. 


I'm pretty fucked up though. it might be best to have a night off. A nice walk would be the best idea.  


I'm tired right now. Tonight I want to be in bed early reading a book. 

Okay, focus. I want exercise because it's good for me. But I'm currently near-buggered.  


## 12/06/19 13:30 
Okay, next is exercise, but there's also the feeling that I'm *tired*. Next THING is switch accounts to steam.   

## 12/06/19 14:14 
Really NOT pulling this. Exhaused. Going to fill up on food and have a bath.

## 12/06/19 17:03

Sleep has to be a primary THING.
