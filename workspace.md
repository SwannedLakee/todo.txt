Checked that it was easy to copy paste images into powerpoint. 

But the importing of images. Hmm.  

[This vim tip](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Drag_and_drop_file_names_into_the_Vim_command_line) suggests that I can do it by drag and drop into the command line, which futher suggests that I could simply write a command that took it as an argument. 

The possibilities are these: Either create a command line script that drops the markdown into the clipboard, or create a vim command that inserts it directly.  "/Users/josephreddington/Desktop/Screenshot\ 2019-05-25\ at\ 16.38.47.png" 

Or directly insert... 

...which only will really work if they are in the image directory, but is a reasonable way of doing it in the circumstances.

Testing Comic for Yesterday. 



So what's the theme. 



What did I do yesterday that I was proud of: 

Breakfast in bed. 
* Sorting boxes from home. 
* Getting the crap kicked out of me. 

This is an ordered THING, so it's pretty easy to set up into a comic I think .

I'm suddenly wondering how much of this I can do with CSS... Possibly the first page at least...


Like, I'm pretty sure that the text is pretty doable, and they layout is. And lots of THINGs can be automated. Including print-as-pdf.   


Like, it would be genuinely harder to put THINGs into Instagram, but a lot easier to put them in? Right? No, harder, would definately be harder, The only THING we like is that the images might also have the text. It would be good to generate the text for something else, but we like it where it is.   





## 27/05/19 18:21 Oh, Annyoing the HEIC images don't wokr. 


## 27/05/19 21:31 
Hmmm, So, there's a potential for a html based version. But I feel like it doesn't gain anything in the final solution. 


However, there is quite a lot we can do to improve the look of penfold. Mostly in the css.

Going to get started with redit

So what would the comic of yesterday be? 


So, slight problem in that I've only got two photos.  What did I do? 


It was actually quite a good day. But never mind that. Let's sort out this.

So, what was I doing yesterday? I was making a comic and making it easy to insert pictures into issue.  



## 28/05/19 09:53 
Hello. I think today's comic is going to be about FFT and coding, and writing up. Also removing from Dropbox.

Ringing mum about account 

## 28/05/19 10:07 rang gale about the accounts as well. 



Brief Summary: A combination of illness, poor timing, and Not Knowing the rules means we are very likely to pay a Â£150 fine for late filling of accounts.  

Less brief: Some time ago we engaged Stephen Shepard to do our accounts for 2017-2018. He produced some accounts that, on inspection, were incorrect (counting grants as direct income for example). He also resigned shortly afterwards as trustees will remember.  Since then we moved our bookkeeping entirely onto Quickbooks, tightened various things up, and Joe started taking accounting exams. The updated plan was for Joe to produce the end of year accounts after Comic Relief and SHINE finished at the end of March. (They are due at the end of May) In the middle of last week it became clear that, because our turnover is high, accounts need to be submitted by an external person. We rang TLL (our old accountants) to get an assessment and they are happy to do them, but, because of the rules of their association, Stephen has to 'release' the accounts to TLL (effectively to stop companies trying to slip dodgy accounts past multiple accountants).  TLL's assessment was, effectively "By the time we've got the permissions back you're going to pay the late fine".  This is my fault on a few counts, partly misjudging Steven, but also not being on top of Comic Relief enough to do this early. 

I do need to offically tell you that I'm planning on offically enguaging TLL to do the accounts.
