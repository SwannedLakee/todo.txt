# Workspace 
##  Notes from current sprint 

## 12/05/19 09:52 
I'm going to do some recreational coding because I'm pretty tired.

Here's what I'd like to do today
- Count the workspace SASs
  - Create test files 
- Add date to all of the tasks (within vim)  
- Document .vimrc 
- Produce the 'last hour forensis' 

## 12/05/19 10:03
Starting with 'Count the workspace SASs" 
- 12/05/19 smallest next step:  Make a list of what you want the input and the output to look like. 


Input: this file and the follower file 
Output: CSV of 
11/5/19, 5
10/5/19, 10 

That's the first instance, eventually I might want it split down a little differently. 

## 12/05/19 10:06, Thinking. 
This is going to measure how much I follow a process, but it's exploitable because I can only follow the process when something is the most important THING.  

## 12/05/19 10:08 
Starting to think that I shouldn't do this THING at all. 
Going back to basics.  What is the Thing I want: 


* To process the important THINGs first and properly, and to avoid wasting time. 
  * "What percentage of my time am I working on the most important THING right there.
