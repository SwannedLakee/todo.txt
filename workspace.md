##  Notes from current sprint

Thinking about comics. Let's talk about this. 

The goal is to take control of my day's narrative. Make it a positive one.  
Other goals include: taking more photographs, sharing more with friends. Experimenting and learning more about art.  

There's lots of different styles I'd like to try: 

* B&W (Sin city) 
* Old-school comic book
* Japanses 
* Very simple line drawings. 


What's our premise? That our central character is trying to pretend not to be sick? 


What's our premise? That our central character is a normal human being who can do superhuman THINGs when he confesses is small THINGs 
How about we throw away everything other than that? 

Today's THING is that I am sick and I don't have enough energy.

Okay, today is about Kat's owrk. 

I've got some code to run. 


What's the steps? 

* Find and open the folder 
* Take git snapshot
* Look at the old tests see which ones can be/should be changed. 


## 16/05/19 10:16 
I'm looking at the code and it's a mess. There should be nice classes and lots of other thTHINGings. 

What's the best way of structuring this code? 
What are the objects? 

Student
Exam

Each student is linked to one or more exams. Each exam is linked to one or more students. 

Oh, it was taking a really long time last time right? I couldn't work out why? have I got that right? 

## 16/05/19 10:20, Running tests 

We should disconnect the output on the word document from any other output. This includes making a fake class that accepts the same commands and is used as a test. 


## 16/05/19 10:21, 
Tests should execute quickly, we need to drop the one that takes ages. 

## 16/05/19 10:21 
Maybe start entirely again? 

## 16/05/19 10:31 
Okay, I've started an new THING, and the next THING to do is to get it to read all of the students from the student file 

- 16/05/19 smallest next step:  read file of students 

## 16/05/19 10:57 
I've learned something new and that's cool. I'm also technically looking for a bigger problem to write a test for.  

Obvious bigger problem would be to read in exams, but I want to check in with Kat before I do that, particularly because I'll want to read in the exam answers as well. 

Todo: 

* Student print_string method 
* build up the student more from the information given.
