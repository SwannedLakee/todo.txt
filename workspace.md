# Workspace 
##  Notes from current sprint 

## 12/05/19 09:52 to 10:21: 
I started wanting to do some recreational coding, but after thinking about it for a while, and working through the ideas, I think I might want something else. 

I decided I want a system that: 
* Captures the context of where I am
* Knows what the next action to do is. 

...and I want to measure the amount of times in the day that the list pops 

So, what's the best way of doing that? I think I want a command that is literally "Pop", with a little sound effect  
...and I want to log how often I pop in a day. 

## 12/05/19 10:27 
Let's make something pretty... 
So I want a bit of a code that runs pop, but also, raises the stakes as I move up the ranks. 

Effectively I want it to read the code and then make an animated cool THING that builds up every time I upgrade the system.: 


So what's the play? 

* Play a sound 
* Save state, play another sound as the state gets bigger 
* Display the state, which is listed somewhere. 
* This is game developement. 

Simplify it, I only want a record of how long a streak I managed. I can literally only look at that at the end of the day. So let's look at the simple use: 

* Opendiff between the current version and the version at the start of the day. 
	* Pro: Easy, write it down on paper 
	* Con: if high priority tasks are added halfway thought the day. 
Check: what was my streak from Friday. 


## 12/05/19 10:14, So let's brainstorm other charts 
Here's what I'd like to do today
- Add date to all of the tasks (within vim)  
- Document .vimrc 
- Produce the 'last hour forensis' 





## 12/05/19 10:10 
What do I want.  
* To always know what's next?  (DELROES) 
* To be able to capture the context properly. 




##  New actions
