Let's get started

Now exercise. 
 
I honestly haven't done any exercise since friday. I need to do some, that's without question. But I've got this shoulder THING and I'm a bit ill.  

I need to go for a walk. A nice long walk. That's a good idea.    


No...   Let's work out the plan.

Run tonight. 
Train tomorrow. 
Run Wednesday with Nova before Caroline.  
Run Thursday with Nova before Caroline 
Train Friday night. 
Caffine isn't making life better, so try some other teas. 


Okay, so what do I need to do to ensure that I run later. 

I need the kit out.

Okay, got the kit on. Will go out later I think. Short, ZR run.
