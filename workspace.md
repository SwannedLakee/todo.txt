# Flowers for Turing 
I'm posting to reddit to raise money. 

Problem: is that larger subreddits are removing the post too quickly. 

I'm going to email them to see what's going on. 


Hi there, 

Understand you guys are very busy. I posted to your subreddit recently and the post disappeared. I wondered if you could give me a little help understanding why. 


Hi, I had a post removed recently and I don't understand which of the rules it broke. Could you help me out? 

It was a cross post of this:   we're doing a real world event around Alan Turing and it seems to be giving people good feelings? 

I'd love to be able to share any aspect of the project with the XXX community, if I knew which rules had been broken I'd be able to change what I was writing.

Website is broken, what are the options. 

* run from the old account and see if you really did create them properly. 
* do git stash and see if it was you.
