##  Notes from current sprint 

Today is all about the Children in Need grant 

## 02/09/19 10:50 
Back to complete the grant, starting with the budget 


## 02/09/19 10:52 to 11:16,
It's a midnight deadline and I've put a call out for reviewers 

Some back of the envelope calculations, based on how it worked on the pilot suggests that the leader needs 16 hours per school to get something started and then come back for research collection, including setting up and transport and faff.  It's actually less for part time staff presuming that they can fit in for when schools want them. Given the proper school year we're thinking that a full time facilitator can do 50 schools and 0.5 can do 30, with 20 for 0.3.  

Fitting a reasonable project into Â£10k a year is going to be hard - we're going to be absorbing a lot of this into the core costs if it comes off.  But we do believe in it as a project. 

I've cut the project manager role right down. It's come out at 999.30 which I'm willing to take.  

So we're hoping for 40 schools over the two year project. Or 60 over three. 


## 02/09/19 11:24 to 11:49, Worked out an answer and quickly blogged it.

## 02/09/19 13:50 Okay, taking a break now and will maybe take another stab at it before Kat reads it but otherwise is goodho
