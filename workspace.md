##  Notes from current sprint 



## 27/05/19 10:38 to 11:00, Penfold
I've been working on getting penfold working, because I think that will help with comics. 



## 27/05/19 11:01, 
Some bugs: refresh isn't working well...  



## 27/05/19 11:10 
Working on the import scripts some more.  

[This person](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/14114/paste-link-to-image-in-clipboard-when-editing-markdown) knows exactly what I want.





## 27/05/19 11:26 
I've installed their plugin, but it needs xclip apparently. 


## 27/05/19 11:42 
I believe I have it working, but only for images in the clipboard, rather than files in the clipboard. Needs a bit of extension there.  

## 27/05/19 11:48 
Asked a question [here](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/20121/echo-hasmac-returns-0-but-im-on-a-mac)

Hmm, okay so there is a problem with image insertion in general, and I'm unsual how to deal with that, presumably the easy way is to change something in penfold. Let's have a look. 



## 27/05/19 11:55 to 12:04 
So, a summary, 

* Penfold is now faster to setup and get going. 
* We've used a vim plugin to make it easy to import images, we've also opened an issue for the plugin [here](https://github.com/ferrine/md-img-paste.vim/issues/12) and asked [a suitable SE question here](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/20121/echo-hasmac-returns-0-but-im-on-a-mac) so that we might be able to fix it ourselves. 

We can demonstrate the new functionality below.

Hopefully this work makes it much easier to keep track of things and to make our comic.
