Working on watson, mostly googling about timezones and trying to get 'blank' tags to show up. 
* [200~https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35645402/how-to-specify-timezone-in-ics-file-which-will-work-efficiently-with-google-outl[201~ would be a good way of starting to deal with the timezone problem - except that I don't specify the timezone so I'd need some code that returned if it was  BST atm.  


This is a minor thing, I'd rather get other bits working. But get them working with tests as well.   
* It turns out that there is an ongoing issue with timezones and this library

And walking over to library. 

## 30/07/19 13:00 to 13:38, Working on Watson. +EQT
* I've found out that the code breaks if there is a singleton entry at the end (it sets the ending to None)
* I've added blanks to the calendar 
* Watson now imports both workspace and historical notes 

Next todos: 
* Transfer content to historical notes. 
* Push everything to server 

No, this is procrastinaton. Any more work on this needs to be in my free time. What's the actual next action?
