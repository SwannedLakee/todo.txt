Notes on 19: 
* We like Giroscope
* School of Law, Forensic Psycjolgy 
* Project title doesn't give anything away. 
* The summary has many long words, but also doesn't actually say what it's doing to the reader... 
* Ah, this is a pilot. 
* Ah, they are running focus groups. Excellent. 
* I feel like they just threw myscoiety into the mix there. 
* Disemination seems rubbish. 
* LCK's fingerprints are all over this. Lot of fucking lego.  
* I have NO Idea what a co-designed digital platofrm is. 
* "less than 40% are ex ofenders" up to 30 
* Still NO idea what a platform is. 

While waiting...
