# Submit Application to NI Funder by 30th September 
A funder in NI has invited us to put forward a bid to run Superhero Cyborgs in Belfast.  This is nice, but it requires a bit of running around to set up in a new city. It's also the first time we've *properly* costed this out, so that's interesting in its own right 

# Resources 
* [Our original Blog post](http://equalitytime.co.uk/4634/2015/01/05/superhero-cyborgs-surprisingly-even-cooler-than-it-sounds/)
* [The Organisation that delivers the US version](http://kidmob.org/superheroboost)
* [Our application so far](https://www.dropbox.com/home/eQuality%20Time/Staff%26TrusteesOnly/Projects/SuperheroCyborgs)

# Todo 
Confirm project partners - 
* Set a price with Farset: Phone call?
* Chase university 

Write Document - 
* Copy and paste from email 
* Work out how to say: This isn't for many kids but it is going to train up a bunch of other students 

Costs
* Confirm with Farset 
* Work out proper average prostetic cost (email Open Bionics) 
* Get costs from KG. 
* Get own costs: getting to NI, accomodation for a week, DBS checks. Staff time. 
  * Flight and transport is probably £250 by the time all the costs are included. Travelodge would be £70 a night all in so six nights? 420
  * It's actually pretty close, for us, to a WWW camp but we have to set asside a grand to hire the room. Up to 2K, need materials and the rest is to  

Venue
* We're investigating two - the university and the makerspace - the makerspace might have some availability issue but it's a start

I've been looking for a venue in Belfast and I've also asked on social media for university manufacturing labs 

There is one https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk/about/facility.html at £200 a day - need to ask
