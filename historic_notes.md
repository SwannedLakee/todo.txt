Went on a bit of a thinking journey. I ended up with the plan that Workspace should have a special symbol for when I've ticked off the issue on top of the stack, and I should keep track of that on paper for the moment.  If I can do that for a week then I'll write some more code.

Doing the Code for Kat. 

Most of today is about restructuring, moving into classes and using the new input files. A lot of today was working out why some tests are slow and that got a lot to do with the speed of the python-docx library.  

One of the activities I ended up trying earlier was starting from scratch, it got my brain in gear and that was great, and it meant I learned some things about how to make tests better
